Problem
The purpose of this problem is to verify whether the method you are using to read input data is sufficiently fast to handle problems branded with the enormous Input/Output warning. You are expected to be able to process at least 2.5MB of input data per second at runtime.

Input
The input begins with two positive integers n k (n, k<=107). The next n lines of input contain one positive integer ti, not greater than 109, each.

Output
Write a single integer to output, denoting how many integers ti are divisible by k.

Sample 1:
Input
Output
7 3
1
51
966369
7
9
999996
11
4
Explanation:
The integers divisible by 33 are 51, 966369, 9,51,966369,9, and 999996999996. Thus, there are 44 integers in total.

Answer:


#include <bits/stdc++.h> 

using namespace std;

int main() {
	ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
	cin.tie(NULL);

	// Read the input n, k
	int n, k;
	cin >> n >> k;

	// ans denotes number of integers n divisible by k
	int ans = 0;

	for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		int t;
		cin >> t;
		
		if (t % k == 0) {
			ans++;
		}		
	}

	// Print the ans.
	cout << ans << "\n";	
		
	return 0;
}

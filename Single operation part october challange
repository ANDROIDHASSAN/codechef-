Problem
Chef has the binary representation SS of a number XX with him. He can modify the number by applying the following operation exactly once:

Make X := X \oplus \lfloor \frac{X}{2^{Y}} \rfloorX:=X⊕⌊ 
2 
Y
 
X
​
 ⌋, where (1 \leq Y \leq |S|)(1≤Y≤∣S∣) and \oplus⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Chef wants to maximize the value of XX after performing the operation. Help Chef in determining the value of YY which will maximize the value of XX after the operation.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines of inputs - the first containing the length of binary string SS.
The second line of input contains the binary string SS.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, the value of YY which will maximize the value of XX after the operation.

Explanation:
Test case 11: Since S = 10S=10 is the binary representation of 22, the current value of X = 2X=2. On choosing Y = 1Y=1, XX becomes 2 \oplus \lfloor \frac{2}{2^{1}} \rfloor = 32⊕⌊

Test case 22: Since S = 11S=11 is the binary representation of 33, the current value of X = 3X=3. On choosing Y = 2Y=2, XX becomes 3 \oplus \lfloor \frac{3}{2^{2}} \rfloor = 33⊕⌊

answer:

#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int t;
    scanf("%d",&t);
    while(t--)
    {
        int l, count = 0;
        scanf("%d",&l);
        char str[l];
        scanf("%s",str);
        for(int i = 0;str[i]!='\0';i++)
        {
            if(str[i]=='1')
            {
                count++;
            }
            else{
                
                break;
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n",count);
        
    }
    return 0;
}

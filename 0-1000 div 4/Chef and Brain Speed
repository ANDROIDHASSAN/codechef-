Problem
In ChefLand, human brain speed is measured in bits per second (bps). Chef has a threshold limit of XX bits per second above which his calculations are prone to errors. If Chef is currently working at YY bits per second, is he prone to errors?

If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

Input Format
The only line of input contains two space separated integers XX and YY — the threshold limit and the rate at which Chef is currently working at.

Output Format
If Chef is prone to errors print YES, otherwise print NO.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings yes, Yes, yEs, and YES will all be treated as identical).

Constraints
1 \leq X, Y \leq 1001≤X,Y≤100
Sample 1:
Input
Output
7 9
YES
Explanation:
Chef's current brain speed of 99 bps is greater than the threshold of 77 bps, hence Chef is prone to errors.

Sample 2:
Input
Output
6 6
NO
Explanation:
Chef's current brain speed of 66 bps is not greater than the threshold of 66 bps, hence Chef is not prone to errors.

Sample 3:
Input
Output
31 53
YES
Explanation:
Chef's current brain speed of 5353 bps is greater than the threshold of 3131 bps, hence Chef is prone to errors.

Sample 4:
Input
Output
53 8
NO
Explanation:
Chef's current brain speed of 88 bps is not greater than the threshold of 5353 bps, hence Chef is not prone to errors.


answer:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // your code goes here
    int x,y;
    cin>>x>>y;
    if(y>x)
    cout<<"YES";
    else
    cout<<"NO";
    return 0;
}

Explanation:
Test case 11: Chef will be required to attend the MasterChef's classes for 11 week and the cost of classes per week is 1010 coins. Hence, Chef will have to pay 1010 coins in total.

Test case 22: Chef will be required to attend the MasterChef's classes for 11 week and the cost of classes per week is 1515 coins. Hence, Chef will have to pay 1515 coins in total.

Test case 33: Chef will be required to attend the MasterChef's classes for 22 weeks and the cost of classes per week is 1010 coins. Hence, Chef will have to pay 2020 coins in total.

Test case 44: Chef will be required to attend the MasterChef's classes for 22 weeks and the cost of classes per week is 1515 coins. Hence, Chef will have to pay 3030 coins in total.

ANSWER:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	int t;

    int A;
	int B;
	cin>>t;
	while(t)
	{
	    

	    
	    cin>>A>>B;
	        cout<<A*B<<endl;
	        t--;
	    
	   
	}
	return 0;
}
